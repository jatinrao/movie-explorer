Here are some deployment options:

1. Netlify
2. Vercel
3. AWS S3 + CloudFront
4. AWS with EC2 and Nginx
5. GitHub Pages
6. Cloudflare Workers
7. Firebase Hosting

I will pick top 2 out of given option for comparison (Both can be used depending upon roadmap of the app) :
As Vercel and Netlify are similar in most of aspects and offering, combining as one option:

| Aspect                 | Vercel/Netlify                                                                                      | AWS S3 + CloudFront                                                                                      |

| **Secret Management**  | Environment variables via dashboard; no dedicated secret manager needed                             | Requires AWS Secrets Manager or similar for secure management                                            |

For current version of movie-explorer, although we donâ€™t require Server side rendering or SSG or Edge functions its better to go with vercel/Netlify as we might require to add APIs in future for reasons like proxy implementation or backend Integration for secrets if our backend service handles secret management. It will be easier to add functionality as compared to AWS.

Vercel/Netlify is also a preferred choice in terms of ease of Deployment pipeline setup as it won't require any additional dependencies like Jenkin and secret manager (AWS service) plus give some essential utility out of the box like analytics ,performance tracker, branch URLs etc.

AWS (S3 + cloudfront) can be used if no more changes in terms of architecture are not required and we need a higher level of control or customization for deployment pipeline.
